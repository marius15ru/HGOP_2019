# Docker Exercise
Learning the basics of creating a Docker container and learning about the benefits of containers.

## What is Docker?
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers package all its code separately from the local environment they run on, which means they will operate the same from one computing environment to another.

## What is the difference between:
* Virtual Machine
* Docker Container
* Docker Image

A VM creates a whole virtual os, while Docker containers are run by a single os kernel and only require things not already running on the host computer. 
Containers and images are in many ways like Classes and Objects. A running instance of an image is a container.

## Web API?
A Web API is an API for either a web server or browser where the communication takes place using the Internet and Web-specific protocols and, generally, serve through a HTTP interface.

## Postgres?
Postgres is a relational database management system that uses the SQL language.

## package.json file dependencies field:
All dependencies of a node project are listed in the dependency field and define the external packages the project requires.

## npm express package:
Is a fast and lightweight web framework for Node.js. From the node package manager.

## npm pg package:
Is a non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js.

## What is docker-compose:
Is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications and defines how containers interact and communicate with one another.

## Results
We created a neat little application and we learned the basics about Docker and containers.
